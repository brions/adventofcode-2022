# Welcome to the 2022 Advent of Code project
Each year in December the Advent of Code event takes place much like an advent calendar.  Each day from Dec. 1 to Dec. 25th a new coding problem is made available to solve.

There is no restriction on the language used to solve of the amount of time to solve it (usually) but solving the problem gives you a *gold star*. The point is to
collect 50 gold stars by the 25th (meaning you were able to complete both problems each day - there is always a bonus problem once you solve the primary one).

This project is for fun and personal growth and I encourage anyone interested in programming to give it a shot because it's fun an low-stakes.

The Advent of Code site can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/
You will need to sign up using some way to verify yourself (like Google OAuth or GitHub OAuth), and then the problems will be made available to you.

Coding, compiling, and running is left to you. The problems simply ask you for the answer and when you submit it on the site it will tell you whether or not you are correct,
record your star, and possibly open up the bonus problem to solve.

Have fun coding!

Constructive feedback on better ways I could have written my code is appreciated.
